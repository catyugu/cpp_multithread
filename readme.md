## 1\. The Fundamentals: What is a Thread?

  - **Process vs. Thread:** A process is an instance of a running program with its own memory space. A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads within the same process share memory.
  - **Concurrency vs. Parallelism:**
      - **Concurrency:** Dealing with multiple tasks at once (can be on a single CPU core).
      - **Parallelism:** Doing multiple tasks at the same time (requires multiple CPU cores).

**Key Takeaway:** Multi-threading allows a single process to perform multiple tasks concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness.

-----

## 2\. Creating and Managing Threads

  - **Core Class:** `std::thread` (from `<thread>` header).
  - **Execution:** A `std::thread` object is initialized with a callable (function, lambda, etc.) that will be executed in the new thread.
  - **Lifecycle:** A thread must be managed before its `std::thread` object is destroyed.
      - `join()`: The calling thread waits for the new thread to complete.
      - `detach()`: The new thread is separated from the `std::thread` object and runs in the background. Use with caution.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void task() {
    std::cout << "Hello from new thread!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::thread my_thread(task);
    std::cout << "Hello from main thread!" << std::endl;
    my_thread.join(); // Wait for the thread to finish
    return 0;
}
```

**Best Practice:** Always prefer `join()` over `detach()`. Ensure threads are joined to prevent bugs and resource leaks.

-----

## 3\. The Problem: Data Races

  - **Definition:** A data race occurs when two or more threads access the same memory location concurrently, at least one access is a write, and there is no synchronization.
  - **Result:** **Undefined Behavior**. This is the most dangerous category of bugs in C++.
  - **Example:** A simple `counter++` operation is not atomic. It's a three-step read-modify-write process that can be interrupted, causing updates to be lost.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
// UNSAFE CODE
int counter = 0;
void increment() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) {
        counter++; // DATA RACE!
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaway:** Unsynchronized access to shared data is the root of all evil in concurrent programming.

-----

## 4\. Mutexes and Locks

  - **Purpose:** To solve data races by ensuring **Mutual Exclusion**.
  - **Mechanism:** A `std::mutex` acts like a lock. A thread must `lock()` the mutex to enter a **critical section** (code that accesses shared data) and `unlock()` it upon exit.
  - **RAII is King:** Manual `lock()`/`unlock()` is dangerous. If an exception occurs, `unlock()` might be skipped, causing a deadlock. Always use RAII wrappers:
      - `std::lock_guard`: Simple, efficient scoped lock. Acquires lock on creation, releases on destruction. The default choice.
      - `std::unique_lock`: More flexible than `lock_guard`. Can be unlocked before its scope ends. Required for condition variables.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <mutex>

std::mutex mtx;
long long counter = 0;

void safe_increment() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(mtx); // Lock is acquired
        counter++;
    } // Lock is automatically released here
}
```

**Best Practice:** **Always** use `std::lock_guard` or `std::unique_lock` to manage mutexes.

-----

## 5\. Condition Variables

  - **Purpose:** To solve the problem of **busy-waiting** (spinning), where a thread wastes CPU cycles repeatedly checking for a condition.
  - **Mechanism:** A `std::condition_variable` allows a thread to efficiently `wait()` (sleep) until notified by another thread.
  - **Components:** Requires a `std::mutex`, a `std::unique_lock` (for the `wait` call), and a shared state/condition to check.
  - **Operations:**
      - `wait(lock, predicate)`: Atomically releases the lock, puts the thread to sleep, and re-acquires the lock upon waking up, but only if the predicate is true. The predicate protects against spurious wakeups.
      - `notify_one()`: Wakes up one waiting thread.
      - `notify_all()`: Wakes up all waiting threads.

**Key Takeaway:** Condition variables are the standard tool for building efficient producer-consumer queues and managing complex synchronization workflows.

-----

## 6\. Futures and Promises

  - **Purpose:** To get a result back from a task running in another thread.
  - **Mechanism:** A high-level, one-time communication channel.
      - `std::promise`: The "write" end of the channel. The worker thread uses it to `set_value()` or `set_exception()`.
      - `std::future`: The "read" end of the channel. The calling thread uses its `get()` method to block and wait for the result.
  - **The Easy Way: `std::async`**: The `std::async` function launches a task and immediately returns a `std::future` that will hold its result. This is often the simplest and best tool for the job.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <future>

int calculate_something() { /* ... long computation ... */ return 42; }

int main() {
    // Launch the task asynchronously
    std::future<int> result_future = std::async(std::launch::async, calculate_something);
    // ... do other work ...
    int result = result_future.get(); // Blocks until result is ready
    return 0;
}
```

**Best Practice:** Prefer `std::async` for simple asynchronous tasks that return a value.

-----

## 7\. Atomic Operations

  - **Purpose:** To provide **lock-free** thread safety for simple operations on single variables.
  - **Mechanism:** `std::atomic<T>` (from `<atomic>`) guarantees that operations like incrementing, reading, or writing a variable `T` are indivisible. These are often implemented with special hardware instructions and are much faster than mutexes.
  - **Key Operations:** `load()`, `store()`, `fetch_add()`, `exchange()`, and the powerful Compare-and-Swap (`compare_exchange_strong`).

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
#include <atomic>

std::atomic<long long> atomic_counter = {0};

void atomic_increment() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) {
        atomic_counter++; // This is now a single, thread-safe operation
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaway:** Atomics are for protecting single variables; mutexes are for protecting larger critical sections or complex invariants.

-----

## 8\. The C++ Memory Model

  - **Purpose:** Defines the rules for how and when a write operation in one thread becomes visible to a read in another. It prevents unexpected instruction reordering by the compiler and CPU.
  - **Core Concept:** The **happens-before** relationship. If operation A happens-before B, A's effects are visible to B.
  - **Memory Orders:** Atomics can take memory order arguments (`std::memory_order_...`) that specify the strength of the ordering guarantee.
      - `memory_order_relaxed`: Weakest, only guarantees atomicity.
      - `memory_order_release`/`acquire`: A pair that ensures writes from one thread are visible to another.
      - `memory_order_seq_cst`: Strongest and the **default**. Provides a single global order for all such atomic operations.

**Best Practice:** You don't need to worry about the memory model when using mutexes and futures. When using atomics, **stick to the default memory order** unless you are an expert and have a proven performance need.

-----

## 9\. Pattern: Thread Pools

  - **Purpose:** To avoid the high cost of creating and destroying threads for many short-lived tasks.
  - **Mechanism:** A fixed number of worker threads are created once. Tasks are submitted to a thread-safe queue. Idle workers pick up tasks from the queue, execute them, and go back to waiting.
  - **Implementation:** A classic thread pool uses a `std::vector<std::thread>`, a `std::queue` for tasks, and a `std::mutex`/`std::condition_variable` pair for synchronization.

**Key Takeaway:** A thread pool is the standard, high-performance solution for managing a large number of asynchronous tasks.

-----

## 10\. Tool: Thread-Local Storage

  - **Purpose:** To create variables that are global in scope but private to each thread.
  - **Keyword:** `thread_local`.
  - **Mechanism:** A variable declared `thread_local` has thread storage duration. Each thread gets its own independent copy, which is initialized on first use and destroyed when the thread exits.
  - **Use Cases:** Storing per-thread caches, error codes (`errno`), or non-thread-safe objects.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
// Each thread gets its own private copy of 'counter'.
thread_local int counter = 0;
```

**Best Practice:** Be careful when using `thread_local` with thread pools. The variable's state will persist across tasks executed by the same worker thread, so you may need to reset it manually at the start of each task.

-----

## 11\. Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

  - **Deadlock:** Two or more threads block forever, each waiting for a resource the other holds.
      - **Prevention:** Avoid nested locks. If you must use them, always lock in a consistent order or use `std::scoped_lock` (C++17) to acquire multiple locks safely.
  - **Livelock:** Threads are active but not making progress, stuck in a loop of reacting to each other.
  - **Starvation:** A thread is perpetually denied access to a resource.

**Best Practice:** Always think about resource acquisition order to prevent deadlocks. `std::scoped_lock` is your best friend for locking multiple mutexes.

-----

## 12\. The Golden Rules of C++ Concurrency

1.  **Protect All Shared Data:** No exceptions.
2.  **Use RAII for Locks:** `std::lock_guard` and `std::scoped_lock` are essential.
3.  **Prefer High-Level Tools:** Use `std::async` and thread pools before manual thread management.
4.  **Keep Critical Sections Short:** Don't hold locks while doing slow I/O or other blocking operations.
5.  **Avoid Nested Locks:** If you can't, use `std::scoped_lock` or a strict locking hierarchy.
6.  **Trust the Defaults:** Stick to default memory orders for atomics.
7.  **Design for Clarity:** Simple, correct code is better than clever, buggy code.
8.  **Manage Thread Lifecycles:** Always `join()` or `detach()` threads.
